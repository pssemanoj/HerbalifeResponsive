This port aims to use a light dusting of Sass to make Normalize even easier to integrate with your website. To learn about why Normalize.css is so amazing, skip to the \"normalize.css\" section below.\n\nThis Sass port currently utilizes:\n\n* Browser support variables: Allowing you to easily add/drop support for any browser by modifying a single Sass variable.\n* Vertical rhythm mixins: Allowing you to alter the font-size, line-height and margins in Normalize’s output without hacking the library.\n\nIn addition, Normalize.css has 2 major versions: version 4 (without “legacy browser” support) and version 1 (with support for IE 6/7, etc.) This Sass port combines the two versions into one file so that you can easily toggle between the two versions using its browser support variables.\n\nDid a client wait until the last minute to mention their CEO uses IE 6? Simply update your `$support-for` variable and recompile your Sass files. Details can be found at https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss/wiki\n\n# normalize.css v4\n\n> A modern alternative to CSS resets\n\nNormalize.css is a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.\n\nThe project relies on researching the differences between default browser styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need or benefit from normalizing.\n\n[View the test file](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/latest/test.html)\n\n## What does it do?\n\n* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.\n* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.\n* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.\n* Improves usability with subtle modifications.\n* Explains what code does using detailed comments.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall using one of the following methods:\n\n* Download directly from the [project page](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss/releases).\n* Install with [npm](http://npmjs.org/): `npm install --save normalize-scss`\n* Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install --save normalize.scss`\n* Install with [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/normalize-scss): `gem install normalize-scss`<br>\n  and, if using Compass, add `require \"normalize-scss\"` to your config.rb file. Note: if you want to alter the _normalize.scss file after installation (see \"how to use it\" below), you can use the `gem list --details normalize-scss` command to show you where the normalize-scss files were installed.\n\n## How to use it\n\nThere is a fantastic introduction to the project and brief instructions how to use it in the [About normalize.css article](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/).\n\nYou can use the Sass port of Normalize in one of several methods, following the \"About normalize.css\" article's suggestions:\n\n__Approach 1:__ Download and use normalize-scss as a starting point for your own project's base Sass, customising the values to match the design's requirements. (The best approach, _IMO_.)\n  1. Copy the normalize-scss files to your sass directory so that you can alter it\n    as you include it in your project. To aid with this method, normalize-scss\n    includes several ready-made \"fork\" versions:\n    * [fork-versions/default](fork-versions/default) - Fork for libSass or Ruby Sass\n    * [fork-versions/ruby-sass-compass](fork-versions/ruby-sass-compass) - Fork for Ruby Sass with Compass\n    * [fork-versions/typey](fork-versions/typey) - Fork with Typey\n    * [fork-versions/typey-chroma-kss](fork-versions/typey-chroma-kss) - Fork with Typey, Chroma and KSS\n  2. The normalize-scss code uses the `support-for` module, so add it\n\n__Approach 2:__ Install and include normalize-scss untouched and then build upon it, overriding the defaults later in your Sass when necessary. Just import normalize-scss like any normal Sass module by:\n  1. Set variables to override the default normalize-scss variables.\n  2. Import with `@import \"normalize\";`\n  3. Output the CSS rules with `@include normalize();`\n\nAlternatively, you can import normalize-scss immediately into your main Sass file without needing to use the `normalize()` mixin by:\n\n  1. (Optionally) set variables to override the default normalize-scss variables.\n  2. Import with `@import \"normalize/import-now\";`\n\nNote: if you use [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep), normalize-scss's bower.json points at the normalize/import-now Sass partial. If you don't wish to immediately output the CSS, you will need to override the Sass partial that wiredep grabs from normalize-scss.\n\n## Browser support\n\n* Chrome (last two)\n* Edge (last two)\n* Firefox (last two)\n* Firefox ESR\n* Internet Explorer 6+\n* Opera (last two)\n* Safari 6+\n\nThe exact browsers supported in your project is controlled by the browser\nsupport variables. See https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss/wiki\n\n\n## Extended details and known issues\n\nAdditional detail and explanation of the esoteric parts of normalize.css.\n\n#### `pre, code, kbd, samp`\n\nThe `font-family: monospace, monospace` hack fixes the inheritance and scaling\nof font-size for preformatted text. The duplication of `monospace` is\nintentional. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Davidgothberg/Test59).\n\n#### `sub, sup`\n\nNormally, using `sub` or `sup` affects the line-box height of text in all\nbrowsers. [Source](https://gist.github.com/413930).\n\n#### `svg:not(:root)`\n\nAdding `overflow: hidden` fixes IE9's SVG rendering. Earlier versions of IE\ndon't support SVG, so we can safely use the `:not()` and `:root` selectors that\nmodern browsers use in the default UA stylesheets to apply this style. [Source]\n(https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-svg-wg/2008JulSep/0339.html).\n\n#### `select`\n\nBy default, Chrome on OS X and Safari on OS X allow very limited styling of\n`select`, unless a border property is set. The default font weight on `optgroup`\nelements cannot safely be changed in Chrome on OSX and Safari on OS X.\n\n#### `[type=\"checkbox\"]`\n\nIt is recommended that you do not style checkbox and radio inputs as Firefox's\nimplementation does not respect box-sizing, padding, or width.\n\n#### `[type=\"number\"]`\n\nCertain font size values applied to number inputs cause the cursor style of the\ndecrement button to change from `default` to `text`.\n\n#### `[type=\"search\"]`\n\nThe search input is not fully stylable by default. In Chrome and Safari on\nOSX/iOS you can't control `font`, `padding`, `border`, or `background`. In\nChrome and Safari on Windows you can't control `border` properly. It will apply\n`border-width` but will only show a border color (which cannot be controlled)\nfor the outer 1px of that border. Applying `-webkit-appearance: textfield`\naddresses these issues without removing the benefits of search inputs (e.g.\nshowing past searches). Safari (but not Chrome) will clip the cancel button on\nwhen it has padding (and `textfield` appearance).\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read Normalize.css' [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nUpdates to most CSS rules should be reported to the upstream [Normalize.css project](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/). Updates to the Sass should be reported in the [Normalize-scss project](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss/).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nNormalize.css is a project by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas),\nco-created with [Jonathan Neal](https://github.com/jonathantneal).\n\nThis Sass port is a project by [John Albin Wilkins](http://john.albin.net).\n\n## Other ports of Normalize.css\n\nFor the record, there are several other Sass ports as well.
