Modern Sassy Buttons
=========================

Based on the original [Compass Sassy Buttons Project](https://github.com/jhardy/Sassy-Buttons), rewritten in SCSS without the need of Compass in favor of using tools such as [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to reduce legacy CSS weight.

Additional button styles will be added in the future, and a 2.0.0 branch will be made for any changes that break current implementations.
