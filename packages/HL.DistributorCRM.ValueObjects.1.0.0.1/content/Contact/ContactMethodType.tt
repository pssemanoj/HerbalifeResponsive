	Set the Namespace, SQL query and connection below to generate a Denum.
	For each row in the data returned, a member will be generated.
	The generator assumes:
		1) The first column contains unique values and is considered the Key value
		2) Column names represent the properties desired on the Denum
		3) Each column returned will become a property. Don't want it - don't query it.
		4) Each row returned will become a member field. Don't want it - don't query it.
		5) The name of this file is the name of the class (minus the .tt extension). It is case sensitive.
